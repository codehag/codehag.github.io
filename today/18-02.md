[x] Update Damp test re: alex‚Äôs comments
[x] browser_markup_load_01.js fails when converting waitForMultipleChildrenUpdates from Task.jsm to async/await
[x] Dentist at 12:30
[x] Fix 6 tests failures on devtools/client/shared due the EventEmitter refactoring


Notes

Wait for damp test results:

- 100 https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=7cba4c6995f1db6e3bc52cac22d65323e5d0e066
- 50 https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=dd383154f908392285865c895588e1a8a452aaa8
- 150 https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=eecefb1bfe2d5b91ceb6e7db4d6d784bc9ce5e25

Issues with browser_markup_load_01.js

- Failing tests on console hang, its leaking windows.
- Intermittent present on regular runs
- unfamiliar with the code, so I‚Äôll take a look at the async/await failure as a primer, there might be something happening in the test that is unexpected
- Speed up on opening the debugger panel may not be as useful as just removing the awaits

Meetings

Performance

- Honza is creating a solution with a modified redux connect for controlling react renders. Question: is the debugger already using a custom connect?
- Babel 7 was merged into tree, and introduced a much more efficient AST traversal
- Currently open work:
  - Files opened from console hangs the browser (two parts, open debugger right away to give the user feedback, and reduce amount of parsing work, looking into julian‚Äôs work from 2017)
  - Debugger is empty
  - New damp test is almost ready
- v17 improved performance significantly
  - Between 4 and 26% faster to open, depending on the document. (bild.de is 26% faster!). Tool is faster to update on reload around 16% on every documents (simple, bild.de and custom)
- v19 current patch shows performance regressions
- Talos hardware has been upgraded on Friday 23, all tests are significantly faster.


Notes

1440322

- we already have potential zombies Promises. the Task.async removal won't introduce new ones
- an already existing one may be highlighted by this patch
- zombies are Promises instantiated by panels, from modules loaded via the browser loader
  (i.e. modules that have `window` and all panel's document global object available in their global scope)
  - these modules are instantiated once for each panel. Whereas the other modules, won't have any such globals, but will be instantiated only once for the whole firefox session.

Notes

Debugger is blank bug

- saw this while writing the damp tests
- looks like it is related to actions being fired before a command is complete, ie resume / pause / step
- writing a mochitest to show the behavior using the damp test files
- looks like this only happens with sourcemapped files

Notes

Talos

- preview is acting funny
  - no symbols, everything is undefined
  - might explain why we were not seeing anything related to the parser worker, perhaps something is broken there with damp tests?

Meetings

jason + yulia
fast preview

  - takes a while to get started because we need the symbols
  - chrome doesnt have this problem, they use codemirror to look at the tokens
  - we can combine our powerful symbol dictionary,  with the code mirror solution

asts + memory

  - this is really big memory wise
  - needed for original files, to look up where the next statement is for async/await when stepping
  - we can throw it away for generated files though

Devtools core

  - sad frenchman (nicolas)
  - has to do the work in devtools core and then port it to mc and then port to debugger
  - lerna kinda works but ‚Ä¶
  - jest is nice, launch pad is nice
  - release cycle sucks
  - not much enthusiasm to move stuff out (console netmonitor) of mc
  - merge heavy used components to debugger

Telemetry Prioritization
Yulia + harald

- updated file
- histogram simulator


----------
8th, Thurs
Currently working on
- Fix dbg-source mochitest Thanks Jason!
- Next damp test: stepping, pausing, etc. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1154874
- revisit overlay
- Meeting with jim


Meetings

Discussion with ola ‚Äúasking technical people questions that are not biased‚Äù

- need to construct a survey for mozilla about how people use javascript (tc39)
- we came up with the following list:
  - Do you have this use case (current js example, if none exists, describe a problem)
  - if yes, how often
  - how would you prefer to solve it (multiple choice)
  - Why do you think its a good solution? (Optional)
  - 7 is the max, 5 is a lot, 4 is perfect
- Todo:
  - Find all teams who work with js (js list) maybe mailing lists
  - Write up a small example survey
  - Determine which questions are team specific

Discussion with Jim re: lazy scripts

- Files and lines of interest:
  - On DebuggerScript, LazyScript and JSScript:
    - DebuggerScript
    - JSScript
    - LazyScript
    - JSFunction (and info about selfhosted code)
  - On `mozilla::variant`
    - Use in the DebuggerScript
    - Definition
- GC in Firefox:
  - Is a generational GC
  - has two generations, Nursery and Tenured:
    - nursery
      - Also see: gc::Cell
      - is a moving pointer, data is allocated in sequence with no attention paid to size
      - if data needs to live longer, it is replace with a forwarding marker and copied over to the ‚Äútenured gc‚Äù
    - Tenured
      - Also see: gc::TenuredCell
      - Data is allocated by type (as they have the same size
      - the rows where data is allocated are referred to as Arenas
  - Does not use Virtual Dispatch (sometimes called dynamic as well)
    - More prone to make mistakes, but better in terms of memory and performance
- Outcomes:
  - DebuggerScript already is capable of using two types, see the use of variant in DebuggerScript
  - ‚Ä¶ (jim?)


Notes

Overlay

- is behaving a bit erratically, will take more work than i thought
  - sometimes shows the overlay, sometimes not
  - is not written in quite the same way as other highlighters, need to ask Patrick about it


----------
7th, Wed
Goals
- revisit overlay
- revisit  telemetry
- Next damp test: stepping, pausing, etc. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1154874


Currently working on ‚Ä¶

- Pause Overlay
  [x] Discuss with alex the next steps
  [x] rebase
- telemetery
  [x] set up meeting with harald this week to discuss telemetry
  [x] update telemetry file
[x] rebase history reducer
- findSources meeting with jim
- dbg-source mochitest is failing


Notes

dbg-source Mochitest is failing

- lets remove dependency ci ‚Äî it is not giving useful information and making it a bit harder to track bugs!
- investigated the fix source tree pr ‚Äî looks like this was a false flag and things were not fixed
  - there seems to be some inconsistency ‚Äî on my machine things are working just fine, david is having an issue and ci was failing
  - no matter what i do, if i add back in the code to clean up the test, it fails for me
- other candidate is logan‚Äôs pr, which is the first place I could find with the same error

History reducer

- rebased!
- handing the following over to wellington:
  - mochitests
  - ui experimentation
  - (screenshots)???????

  [x] rebase
  - mochitests (wellington wants to do it)
- telemetery
  [x] bump loadSource telemetry probe to 20k ms :trollolo:
  [ ] Determine what needs to be done and in what order: telemetry to add
  [x] catch up with the merged telemetry data
- Damp tests
  [x] read through https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1154874
- findSources findScript forces parsing all the scripts
  [ ] read through the bug
- documentation for react perf
  - wrote a comment, interested in feedback


Meetings

performance standup

- some regressions are concerning, specifically the linear regression that occurs with every bundle update: linear load time increase
- telemetry is something that the debugger really needs
- stepping/pausing damp test is something that the debugger really needs
- need to check in after v15 regarding the regression: parser-worker/babel is very slow
Notes
- Wellington wants to work on the history reducer, so I am stepping back from it
- We need better docs regarding react performance, julien is a nice person to talk to about that

Notes

Last two weeks:

- started a blog: http://hag.codes/
- attended tc39 post mortem and planning
- worked quite a bit with memory tools over the last week, thinking a lot about our memory tab and how we can improve it

Memory Panel
I have a couple of ideas of how to improve the memory panel

- better comparison
  - all views (aggregate, dominator, tree) should be comparable
  - limit or filter unchanged data in comparison view (similar to chrome)
- remove tree view, possibly replace it with a simpler graph that is easy to read, and can be compared (maybe a flame chart?)
  - a simple bar graph would be a good first step, with the ability to focus on things that are important
- hide system related data
  - when i take a snapshot of an empty page, i see a lot of of data related to the inspector for example. Chrome hides it behind a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù group in their equivalent of the dominators (i believe they call it summary) view
- using object names for nodes, properties for edges, again similar to chrome
- keep the graphs, improve the naming
- better layout ‚Äî lots of the panels inside of the memory panel have strange ui behavior, ie) are either sized poorly, have really small font, or have an inconvenient scrolling mechanism
  - specifically, the roots graph view needs to be dragged
  - the table is not resizable
  - fonts are very small
- better communication with tools such as the debugger and the performance tab
  - could use these two together
  - potentially we can do both memory and performance recording?
- programmatic snapshots
  - like performance.now()
- recording like chrome? maybe?
